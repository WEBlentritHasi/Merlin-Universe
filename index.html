          <p>Merlin's rival, Morgana is powerful in magic, skilled in manipulation, and often conflicted between her old relationships and her new
          ambition, making her one of the show's most tragic and dangerous figures.
          Her frustration with Utherâ€™s tyrannical rule and his hatred for magic turns into deep resentment. Over time, Morgana
          becomes consumed by her desire for power and vengeance, particularly after experiencing visions of Camelot's downfall.
          She allies with dark forces, seeking to claim the throne and destroy both Uther and Arthur.</p>
